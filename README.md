# Hello! Welcome to the wonderful world of Pokémon

This is my attempt at an implementation of a companion (and maybe more) tool for the hit game, Pokémon Tabletop United

It is my sincere hope that you'll find it useful. Do not hesistate to contact me on discord (The Engie#8298) with any questions, comments, inaccuracies or concerns you may have

## Setup

### Prerequisites

I haven't tried to freeze my code yet with PyInstaller (let alone made docker images), so the only way to run is from source. 

This isn't too bad though considering it's python. The only dependencies are python3, pygame, and pygame-menu.

If you do not have python installed, you can find the download [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). I recommend the highest version number.

You can then install the necessary libraries by running setup.bat

Alternatively, run `pip3 install pygame-menu` in console

## Running

If all prerequisites are installed (correctly), the program can be run with launch.bat

Alternatively, run `python main.py` in console.

### Documentation

I'm going to do my best to do folder-by-folder documentation with readme files. If you have any questions, please make an effort to go through a README file if present, otherwise feel free to reach out.

Object and Data files can be found in ./people_pokemon gui files can be found in ./gui
